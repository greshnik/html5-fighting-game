This is a simple hybrid fighting/platformer game done in html5.

It was done by 2 engineers over a weekend for a [game jam hosted at Google](http://sites.google.com/site/html5gamejam/).

At the moment, the code is in almost the same state it was in at the end of the weekend. It is messy, buggy, and may be a bad example of html5 best practices. On the other hand, it may be interesting from an anthropological perspective as an example of what kinds of shortcuts need to be taken to finish a game in a weekend. Fast prototyping is a useful skill, but demands a different approach than regular software engineering. Clean code takes too long, general solutions are a liability, tests are out of the question, etc.
